# PokeAPI Teambuilder

## Behavior
This Teambuilder site is built with the REACT framework and pulls data from the PokéAPI. Documentation for the PokéAPI can be found here:

https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2

Files of interest are App, ClearAllButton, CreatorButton, PokemonEntry, and SubmissionForm. All of these have a .js and a .css.

The Teambuilder site must be launched from the terminal in order for the application to work properly.

## Input

Clicking the "Creator's Choice" button adds my favorite Pokémon Gengar to the team. If the user wants to add a specific Pokémon, they must provide the correct spelling of the Pokémon's name in lowercase. If such a Pokémon exists, it will be added to the team.

## Output

A maximum of six Pokémon with their appearance, name, typing, abilities, and potential moves displayed.
